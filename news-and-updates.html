    <p>The Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) has established collaboration with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) towards ensuring judicious utilization of interventions funds by Beneficiary Institutions.

        The collaboration between the agencies was sealed when the Executive Secretary of TETFund, Arc. Sonny Echono led the Management of the Fund on a courtesy visit to the Chairman of EFCC, Mr. Ola Olukoyede at his office in Abuja recently.
        
        Speaking at the meeting, Arc. Sonny Echono stated that the visit was to show TETFund’s approval of the Commission’s efforts particularly in ensuring that Education Tax entrusted to the Fund to improve the education landscape of Nigeria is judiciously and prudently utilized for the good of all.
        
        Arc. Echono noted that as part of efforts towards preventing financial infractions, the Fund had in the past taken some preventive measures such as collaboration with the Bureau for Public Procurement (BPP) for enlightenment of heads of Beneficiary Institutions on procurement processes. He, therefore, appealed for a similar forum involving the EFCC and the Fund’s Beneficiary Institutions.
        
        While identifying contract system improvement as an area of focus with the EFCC, he expressed hope that the visit will send a strong signal to Beneficiary Institutions and their contractors on the need for probity and judicious utilization of taxpayers’ money.
        
        In his remarks, EFCC Chairman, Mr. Ola Olukoyede expressed delight with the visit noting that it would create awareness that both agencies are working together. According to him, “when people become aware that we are working together, it will send a signal across to those who want to cut corners or play smart”.
        
        Mr. Olukoyede urged the Fund to show greater commitment to the monitoring of its projects in Beneficiary Institutions to prevent cases of delays, non-execution or abandonment of projects by contractors engaged by the institutions.
        
        He also urged the Executive Secretary to discharge the duties of his office with probity and accountability saying “So much trust has been placed on your shoulders vis-a-viz the source of your revenue, which is taxpayers’ money. Trust is a burden, a big one indeed, particularly when you are ready to be focused and do the right thing. There will be distractions here and there particularly in the environment where we found ourselves, where people are used to cutting corners. But the onus is on us to do the right thing”.  He encouraged the Executive Secretary to always ensure that the right thing is adhered to in line with the statute.
        
        While revealing that over 90 per cent of public corruption cases being investigated by his agency was in the areas of contract and procurement activities, he assured that the EFCC would be willing to collaborate much more with the Fund.</p>

        <img src="image/board.jpg" alt="Gallery Image 1">
    
    </div>
    
    
    <p>TThe Permanent Secretary of Federal Ministry of Education, Dr. Nasir Sani-Gwarzo has identified insecurity as one of the biggest problems threatening the development of education in Nigeria, with a call on the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) to join efforts in tackling the menace.

Dr. Sani-Gwarzo spoke while delivering a paper titled “Re-emerging Education in the Renewed Hope Agenda: The Role of Education in National Development” at the 2024 TETFund Board of Trustees Retreat held in Lagos recently.

The Permanent Secretary revealed that the Ministry of Education was working on new initiatives including workable models aimed at addressing the problem of insecurity in schools across the country.

While emphasizing the need for investment in security including training, Dr. Sani-Gwarzo asked rhetorically: “Have we dedicated funds to support the universities that we are building? Have we discussed as TETFund how do we finance the fighting of insecurity?

“How many of you have been trained on what to do in case of bomb blast, shooting or kidnapping? Do you have prior knowledge?

“Believe me it works, if you train people on what to do. So, I am appealing to TETFund; we are coming up with so many new initiatives including addressing insecurity in schools. We will send the prototype; use models that have worked in the world, but we are going to adapt them to local situation.

“It is not a one-size-fits-all; every location has its security needs but we will give the generic roadmap and apply maximum pressure until everything is implemented and our schools are made safe again,” he assured</p>

    <p>The National Assembly has thrown its weight behind increased funding of higher education and innovative research, noting that they are key to the socio-economic development of the country.

        Chairman of the Senate Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TETFund, Senator, Muntari Dandutse made this known while speaking at the 2024 TETFund Board of Trustees Retreat held in Lagos recently.
        
        While conveying the goodwill of the National Assembly to the TETFund Board of Trustees, he noted the importance and timeliness of holding the retreat with critical stakeholders such as the National Assembly participating.
        
        “We are having this retreat for the first time under the Executive Secretary of TETFund, the leadership of the Board of Trustees and members of the National Assembly. I think it is timely and very important.
        
        “Education is key to the success of each and every country in the world. No matter what is invested in education, I believe it is worth any penny. Considering the population we have in Nigeria, we need to invest more, and we are glad that the Executive Secretary has started to lay a good foundation by involving critical stakeholders such as the National Assembly and leadership of the regulatory bodies.
        
        “If you look at Britain, Germany and most of the developed countries, they started with education. They fund research, innovation and inventions in most of their key areas – in education, agriculture, science and innovation. So, I think it is important to look forward to value addition of funds available and also look forward to increase in terms of funding education,” he said.
        
        On her part, the Chairperson of the House of Representatives’ Committee on TETFund, Hon. Princess Miriam Onuoha commended the Executive Secretary of TETFund, Arc. Sonny Echono for his efforts at repositioning the Fund and organizing the retreat.
        
        While also stating the importance of education to economic development, she assured of the committee’s continued support for the Fund’s activities.
        
        “Pursuant to the mandate of the committee, I would like to restate that our committee remains resolute in our conviction that once we get the education of our people right, we will definitely get our development right; and indeed, place our country back on the right trajectory.
        
        “We have the strong belief that robust deliberation on the theme of this retreat by the stakeholders gathered here today, will further distill the ‘Renewed Hope’ deliverables to a more detailed implementation with turnaround strategies that will not only be measurable but capable of providing results that will also be visible to the Nigerian public,” she said.</p>

    <p>TThe Federal Government has inaugurated the Board of Trustees of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) and Governing Councils of some federal tertiary institutions with a call on them to utilize their expertise to advance their respective institutions.

        The inauguration ceremony was performed recently by the Minister of Education, Prof. Tahir Mamman at the TETFund Auditorium in Abuja.
        
        Speaking at the event, Prof. Mamman congratulated the chairmen and members of the various boards for their appointments with a reminder that the Federal Government had high expectations of them in addressing the challenges facing the tertiary education sub-sector.

        Prof. Mamman also called attention to some challenges the boards could face in their institutions such as low carrying capacity and instability of academic calendar arising from strikes embarked upon by unions over the years.
        
        He disclosed that the government had met with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to address an impending strike by the union.
        
        “We have had some meetings already. We spent some time on Wednesday discussing the issues, and we ended up developing a very robust plan to address them. We hope that what we put in place will help us avoid any form of strike in the universities,” he said.
        
        He also lamented the rising cost of electricity and the eventual disconnection of some institutions by service providers and assured that the Ministry of Education was collaborating with the Ministry of Power to address the challenge. He revealed that the Federal Government was exploring powering institutions with CNG for uninterrupted power supply and cost effectiveness.
        
        In his goodwill message, the Executive Secretary of TETFund, Arc. Sonny Echono congratulated the TETFund Board of Trustees and Governing Councils of the various institutions on their inauguration.
        
        He noted that the education sector is critical to national affairs as the foundation for all development efforts, and Nigeria with its fast-growing youthful population needed to equip them to ensure their contribution to national efforts.
        
        In his goodwill message, ASUU President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, called for judicious utilization of funds accruing to TETFund to foster development, noting that the only thing sustaining public tertiary education in Nigeria remained TETFund.

    <h1>TETFUND WINS 2024 ANTHOLOGY VISIONARY AWARD</h1>
    <div class="news-grid">
        <img src="image/tetfund win.jpeg" alt="Gallery Image 1">
    
    </div>
    
    
    <p>Following the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) efforts to drive the infusion of technology into curriculum and instructional delivery process in Nigeria public tertiary institutions, the Interventionist Agency has emerged as winner of the 2024 Anthology Visionary Award for Leadership in transforming education through technology.

        The event which took place in Orlando World Center in United States before a global audience of over 2000 participants drawn from Academia witnessed the Executive Secretary of TETFund, Arc. Sonny Echono receiving the award on behalf of the Agency.
        
        In his acceptance speech on behalf of the Agency, the Executive Secretary highlighted that the initiative of the Fund are in line with the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu who aims to reposition the education sector in the country, and ensure all graduates of tertiary institutions attain digital literacy before graduation.
        
        Recall that the Federal Ministry of Education under the leadership of Prof. Tahir Mamman unveiled the Tertiary Education Research and Application Systems (TERAS) and Beneficiaries Identity Management System (BIMS) on 17th of October, 2023 at the Federal Ministry of Education Auditorium, Abuja. The Initiative which was driven by TETFund in partnership with Anthology and Blackboard team to promote a more inclusive ecosystem in tertiary institutions and provide wide range services to researchers, students and further enhance teaching and learning process in tertiary institutions.
        
        According to Echono “In today’s digital world, proficiency in digital literacy is not just beneficial; it is essential for academic success and employability. Many countries have successfully integrated digital literacy into their educational systems, reaping the benefits of improved teaching and learning outcomes and accelerated economic growth. With our large youth population and emerging technology industry, Nigeria is uniquely positioned to benefit from similar initiatives.
        
        “However, our curriculum does not adequately address the digital skills required for modern workplaces and everyday life. Some of the identified gaps include: lack of comprehensive digital literacy components in our existing curricula, which results in unprepared graduates who are unprepared for technology-driven job markets; educators are as well not sufficiently trained or resourced to teach critical digital skills; infrastructure such as computers and reliable internet access is inadequate, as many tertiary institutions are either unserved or under served.
        
        “We do not have a digital literacy index to measure and benchmark our standards, and there is significant disparity in digital literacy and access between urban and rural areas, exacerbating educational and economic inequalities.”
        
        To bridge this gap, TETFund as an Intervention Agency is supporting over 280 public tertiary institutions and has laid a strategic plan which will enable all students attain digital literacy before leaving the tertiary education system. The TETFund Boss disclosed at the event that the Agency has designed a phased integration plan across educational levels and equipping educators in the country with necessary digital skills, facilitating critical partnerships with global bodies, and have established National Center of Excellence for Development of Digital Literacy and Emerging Skills.
        
        At the event, over 2000 participants were intimated with the activities and ambitious plans of TETFund, and efforts that have been made to domesticate learning management systems, and better manage student’s information by deploying information systems.</p>

    <h1>The Minister of Education Receives TETFund Ad hoc Committees’ Reports …Says Govt Will Stop Funding of Non-Performing Centres of Excellence</h1>
    <div class="news-grid">
        <img src="image/adhoc.jpg" alt="Gallery Image 1">
    
    </div>
    
    
    <p>The Minister of Education, Prof. Tahir Mamman has received the reports of the TETFund ad hoc Committees on Assessment/Review of TETFund Centres of Excellence and that of the Operationalization of Skills Development Special Intervention, warning that Government will stop the funding of Centres of Excellence that do not meet expectations.

        While stating that productivity was key if the centres desired continuous funding from Government, Prof. Mamman assured that those that have performed well would be encouraged to expand the scope of their activities or get all needed support in specializing their operations.
        
        “The Government is encouraging our scholars to simply rise to the occasion and deliver their scholarship as world class scholars should do, we are not going to reward indolence. We cannot be giving free money to institutions that are not doing what they are supposed to do.
        
        “We are really committed to doing things differently, we also want to raise the equipment level in our tertiary institutions so that they can provide all the skill sets needed in Nigeria in the highest quality that can service the country locally and internationally,” he said.
        
        Speaking on the reasons for the establishment of the Centres, Executive Secretary of TETFund, Arc. Sonny Echono explained that the Fund figured that there were not enough resources available to fund and improve facilities in all tertiary institutions at once. Hence, the idea was to establish one Centre across geopolitical zones and equip it with the right facilities.
        
        “The idea was to incubate, to have one Centre, the right equipment, the right tools and the right faculty and experts that will lead our efforts in research, promotion of scholarship in order to inspire other centres,” he said.
        
        The report of the Committee on Review/Assessment of Centres of Excellence headed by Prof. Oyewale Tomori, recommended that none of the Centres should be upgraded. This is because most of the Centres failed to utilize the first seed grant of N150 million which were allocated for needed infrastructures.
        
        According to Prof. Tomori “For the future selection of TETFund Centres of Excellence, the Agency should identify the areas needing technological advancement and capacity building for national development, and call for proposal that will be subjected to competitive bidding and selection process. In the same vein, TETFund should organize regular and annual project review meetings with the Centres.
        
        “There should also be training and retraining programme for Centre Directors and the head of the units domiciled in the Centre. Since most Centres did not utilize their first seed grant of N150 million for the initial infrastructures required in the Centres, TETFund should provide some bail out funds to the Centres to enable proper take-off of the Centres”.
        
        For the Advisory Committee on Operationalization of TETFund Skills Development Special Intervention, the Chairman of the Committee, Prof. Idris Bugaje who was represented by a member of the committee, Prof. Nuhu Yakubu recommended that polytechnics for the 2024 Special Intervention of TETFund be selected based on geo-political zones.
        
        Recall that TETFund constituted three advisory committees in March to assess the status of its Centres of Excellence, equipment in laboratories and workshops of tertiary institutions and recommend operationalization of the Skills Development Special Intervention programme of TETFund.</p>

    <h1>TETFund has Funded 5,525 Physical Infrastructure in Beneficiary Institutions – Echono</h1>
    <div class="news-grid">
        <img src="image/physical.jpg" alt="Gallery Image 1">
    
    </div>
    
    
    <p>The Executive Secretary of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), Arc. Sonny Echono has disclosed that the Fund has since inception in 2011 funded a total of 5,525 physical infrastructure in its Beneficiary Institutions, thereby bridging infrastructure gaps in the institutions.

        The Executive Secretary made this known recently while speaking at the 26th Seminar of the Nigeria Academy of Education held in Abuja where he delivered a lecture titled “Funding of Tertiary Education in Nigeria”.
        
        Speaking on TETFund’s response to the funding of public tertiary institutions in Nigeria, Arc. Echono stated that in fulfilment of its mandate of providing intervention support towards the rehabilitation, restoration and consolidation of tertiary education in Nigeria, the Fund has also provided funding for 188 equipment fabrication and 576 faculty/departmental libraries in tertiary institutions across the country.
        
        “In addition, the Fund has awarded grants of 19,297 Institutional Based Research (IBR) projects and 912 research projects under the National Research Fund (NRF) which is designed to support impactful research which will contribute to national developmental efforts as well tackle global challenges.
        
        “The fund has also sponsored and supported several research and innovation initiatives such as Research for impact (R4i), TETFund Alliance for Innovation Research (TETFAIR), and the Innovation Fellowship for Aspiring Inventors and Researchers (i-FAIR) programmes targeted at deepening impactful research and uptake of research outcomes with potentials for commercialization as panacea to solving societal problems,” he said.
        
        Speaking on capacity building of staff of Beneficiary Institutions, the Executive Secretary stated that the Fund has sponsored 23,271 academic staff of public tertiary educational institutions in Nigeria for Ph.D programmes, while 15,977 academic staff have been sponsored for Master’s degrees to date.
        
        While noting the importance of tertiary education to sustainable development, Arc. Echono stated the need to sustain the funding of tertiary education in the country.
        
        “Sustainable financing of tertiary education requires predictable and guaranteed funding. Hence, the future lies in sustainable funding, which is clearly rooted in sharing costs, diversifying income sources, creating new sources of income, building partnerships at home and abroad, and creating wealth beyond teaching and research.
        
         
        
        “The funding challenges for tertiary education system inevitably impacts on the individual institutions. The inability of Government to solely and fully finance tertiary education necessitates that the institutions be given the leverage to explore alternative sources of funding to become more efficient and effective in line with new vistas,” he said.
        
        Accordingly, the Executive Secretary recommended that  funding models such as cost-sharing, students loans, scholarships and bursary, R&D, partnerships among others, could be explored as workable options for sustainable funding.
